### Qwen3.8-27B (Q4_K_M) — thinking off, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
Modern. Or contemporary, depending on what you're contrasting it with. Ancient means from a very long time ago, so its opposite points to now: modern for things like technology and ideas, current or present-day when talking about events, recent if something just happened not too far back.
```

**Tool calls and returned results:**

```text
{
  "calls": [],
  "tool_results": []
}
```

**Frozen review rationale:**

```text
Correct requested fact or valid synonym; case, punctuation and explanatory prose accepted. Score is for the requested fact, not all incidental claims.

### Qwen3.8-27B (Q4_K_M) — thinking on, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
Modern. Or if you want the plainest word: **new**. "Ancient" means from a long time ago, so its opposite points at what just happened or hasn't aged yet.
```

### Qwen3.5-4B — repeat 1

Original `correct` score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**.

```text
The opposite of "ancient" depends on what you're comparing it to:

- If something is **very old**, then its opposite would be **new** or **modern**.  
  Example: *Ancient ruins* vs. a brand-new building.

- In terms of time, the direct antonym could also be **recent** or **contemporary**.  

So depending on context, you might say:
- new
- modern
- recent
- contemporary

Which one fits best?
```
