What is the chemical symbol for gold?
```

## Frozen expected answer / allowed tool names

```text
"Au"
```

## Recorded responses

The text below is the harness-delivered response, not a cleaned-up answer. When a response was cut off, the provider may have substituted unfinished reasoning for final text. The cutoff and completion flags remain visible. Empty output is explicitly marked.

### Qwen3.8-27B (Q4_K_M) — thinking off, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
Au. It comes from *aurum*, Latin for "shining dawn." The old symbols don't always match the English name: silver's Ag is from *argentum*.
```

**Tool calls and returned results:**

```text
{
  "calls": [],
  "tool_results": []
}
```

**Frozen review rationale:**

```text
Correct requested fact or valid synonym; case, punctuation and explanatory prose accepted. Score is for the requested fact, not all incidental claims.
```

These are earlier inference runs on the same question, not a thinking-toggle experiment. The trained Nemotron is the calculator adapter, not the rejected clarification pilot.
