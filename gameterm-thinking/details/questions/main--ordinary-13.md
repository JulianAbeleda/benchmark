[All questions](../README.md) · [Models and test design](../models-and-tests.md)

Cohort: `main`. Task: `plain`.

## Recorded responses

The text below is the harness-delivered response, not a cleaned-up answer. When a response was cut off, the provider may have substituted unfinished reasoning for final text. The cutoff and completion flags remain visible. Empty output is explicitly marked.

### Qwen3.8-27B (Q4_K_M) — thinking off, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
He. Helium's atomic number is 2, and it sits at the top of group 18 on the periodic table. It's a noble gas: colorless, odorless, lighter than air, which is why those balloons float up to poke you in the face when they escape.
```

**Tool calls and returned results:**

```text
{
  "calls": [],
  "tool_results": []
}
```

**Frozen review rationale:**

```text
Correct requested fact or valid synonym; case, punctuation and explanatory prose accepted. Score is for the requested fact, not all incidental claims.
```

### Qwen3.8-27B (Q4_K_M) — thinking on, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
Helium is **He**.

It's the second element on the periodic table, one proton in its nucleus, lighter than air, which is why it makes balloons float up toward the ceiling (and then out the window if you're not careful).
```

**Tool calls and returned results:**

```text
{
  "calls": [],
  "tool_results": []
}
```

**Frozen review rationale:**

```text
Correct requested target answer, accepting prose, units and equivalent number forms.
```

Original `correct` score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**.

```text
Helium's chemical symbol is **He**. 

It’s a noble gas that floats up because it’s lighter than air. I like to think of it as one of those things you can’t really see, but if you’ve ever seen balloons float away in the sky, helium was probably helping them do their thing!
