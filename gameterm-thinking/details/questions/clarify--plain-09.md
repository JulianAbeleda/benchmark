### Qwen3.8-27B (Q4_K_M) — thinking off, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
Children. It's one of those old English plurals that didn't follow the normal "add an -s" rule. A few others in the same family: foot/feet, tooth/teeth, goose/geese.
```

**Tool calls and returned results:**

```text
{
  "calls": [],

}
```

**Frozen review rationale:**

```text
Correct requested fact or valid synonym; case, punctuation and explanatory prose accepted. Score is for the requested fact, not all incidental claims.

These are earlier inference runs on the same question, not a thinking-toggle experiment. The trained Nemotron is the calculator adapter, not the rejected clarification pilot.

### Qwen3.5-4B — repeat 1

Original `interaction_success` score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**.

```text
The plural of "child" is **children**.

It's an irregular noun! You don't just add "-s". Instead:
- One child → Two children (or more)

Just like how "mouse" becomes "mice", or "foot" becomes "feet"!
```

```text

  "calls": [],
