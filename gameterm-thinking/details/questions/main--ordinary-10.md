### Qwen3.8-27B (Q4_K_M) — thinking off, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
Wide. Or broad, depending on what you're talking about. A road goes wide or narrow, an idea gets broad or narrow. Same word family either way.
```

**Tool calls and returned results:**

```text
{
  "calls": [],
  "tool_results": []
}
```

**Frozen review rationale:**

```text
Correct requested fact or valid synonym; case, punctuation and explanatory prose accepted. Score is for the requested fact, not all incidental claims.
```

### Qwen3.8-27B (Q4_K_M) — thinking on, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
Wide is the main one. Broad works too, and for things like minds or views you'd say open instead of narrow.
```

**Tool calls and returned results:**

```text
{
  "calls": [],
  "tool_results": []
}
```

**Frozen review rationale:**

```text
States the correct requested fact or accepted equivalent; explanatory prose is allowed.

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

These are earlier inference runs on the same question, not a thinking-toggle experiment. The trained Nemotron is the calculator adapter, not the rejected clarification pilot.

Original `correct` score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**.

```text
The opposite of "narrow" depends on what you're comparing it to:

- **In width**: *wide* or *broad*  
  Example: A wide road vs. a narrow alleyway.

- **In scope or range**: *extensive*, *comprehensive*, or *general*  
  Example: An extensive knowledge base vs. a narrow one focused on just one topic.

- **In perspective or view**: *open* or *unrestricted*  
  Example: Having an open mind instead of a narrow, limited viewpoint.

Which context are you thinking about?
