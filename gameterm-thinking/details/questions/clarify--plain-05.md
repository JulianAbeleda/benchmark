### Qwen3.8-27B (Q4_K_M) — thinking off, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
O. One letter, from its name "oxygen." It's element 8 on the periodic table and makes up most of Earth's atmosphere as O₂, two atoms bonded together.
```

### NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano 30B-A3B (Q4_K_M) — thinking off, repeat 1

Frozen score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**. Review category: `correct_answer`.

```text
Oxygen’s chemical symbol is **O**. It appears on the periodic table as a single‑letter abbreviation. This element makes up about 21 % of Earth’s atmosphere and is essential for most life forms that breathe. If you’d like to explore more about how oxygen behaves in reactions or its role in biology, just let me know!

## Earlier 4B comparison — thinking off

These are earlier inference runs on the same question, not a thinking-toggle experiment. The trained Nemotron is the calculator adapter, not the rejected clarification pilot.

### Original Nemotron 3 Nano 4B — repeat 1

Original `interaction_success` score: **pass**. Completed event: **True**. Output cutoff: **False**.

```text
Oxygen's chemical symbol is O. It represents a single atom of this element in chemical formulas and equations.

I can also tell you that atomic number 8 corresponds to oxygen, which means it has eight protons in its nucleus. The electron configuration fills up the first two shells completely: 2 electrons in the K shell (n=1) and 6 electrons in the L shell (n=2), making a total of 8 electrons.

This element is essential for life on Earth as part of water molecules, respiration processes, and many chemical reactions. It's also highly reactive with metals to form metal oxides, which are often basic compounds like sodium oxide or calcium oxide used in various industrial applications.

Would you like me to explain how oxygen behaves chemically or its role in specific contexts?
